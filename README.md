## Pav bhaji
Pav bhaji is a popular street snack originating from the Indian state of Maharashtra. It consists of a vegetable curry that is typically served with a **soft bread** roll known as **pav**. The dish was invented in the 1850s as a midnight meal by street vendors who prepared it with all the leftover vegetables from the day, which were then mashed and combined with spices and ghee butter but today it is a **favorite street snack** that is also served in some restaurants

# My recomendations places to visit

1. ## Golden Temple
Amritsar is in PunjabState and is the spiritual centre of the Sikh religion. It might be surprising that the GoldenTemple, the holy Sikh temple receives more visitors than the Taj Mahal. Built in the 16th Century, it is located in a beautiful and spectacular complex. When inside the GoldenTemple, one is well aware of the reverence paid to it by all visitors.

| Location | Spending Hours | Amount |
| --- | ----------- | ----- |
