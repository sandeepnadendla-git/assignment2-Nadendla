## Pav bhaji
Pav bhaji is a popular street snack originating from the Indian state of Maharashtra. It consists of a vegetable curry that is typically served with a **soft bread** roll known as **pav**. The dish was invented in the 1850s as a midnight meal by street vendors who prepared it with all the leftover vegetables from the day, which were then mashed and combined with spices and ghee butter but today it is a **favorite street snack** that is also served in some restaurants
